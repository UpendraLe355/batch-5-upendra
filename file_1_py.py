--->(1) Bargained Characters
1.controls and data structures-->ABC language
2.String and its formats-->from C
3.Regular expression-->pearl
4.Exception handling-->Module 3
5.Magic methods from-->fortron

--->(2) WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IS PYTHON
Python is a
> Object oriented programing language
> Dynamically type language
> Scripting language
> Interpreted language-> Identify by it self.
> Compiled language
> Funtional programing language

--->(3) FLAVORS OF PYTHON
> Cpython- Written in C, Most common implementation of python.
> Jython- Java implemantation of python.
> Ironppython- Implementation of the python programming language which is tightly inttegrated with.NET.
> brython- Browser python, runs in browser
> Rubypython- Bridge between python and Ruby interpreter
> Micropython- Runs in micro controllers

--->(4) # print(object, sep, end, file, flush)
#Print has 5 perameters
#object --> the value to be printed is object
# sep--> seperater
# Eg
# a = 8
# b = 9
# c = 89
# print(a, b, c, sep='$')
# end--> which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
# it will not keep the command to stay in same line
#eg:
# print(str(a), b, end='%%')
# print(str(c))

--->(5) VARIABLES
# ?Variable is name which is used to identify the value of variable
# ?which is stored in a specific memory location

#--->(6) RULES TO DEDFINE VARIABLES
# 1) Variable have to start with only alphabets, underscore
# 2) The char following the 1st char can be alphabets,numbers,underscores.
# 3) No spaces are allowed
# 4) No special characecters like !@#$%^&*()+
# 5) Case sensitive
# 6)Keywords are not allowed as variables

CODE---->
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")
print("hello world")

---> commenting
1.)commenting is used for making documentation in a python file
2.)when the line is commented, that line will not be considerd

#print("hello world")

import this
print(this)
from file_1 import a, b
# import is a keyword which is used to communicated between the python files.

#import antigravity

# ! ways to define variables

 a = 7
 b = 7

 a = b =7
print(type(a))
